First Load Ever: 
have to tap on the calorie text box to change it - annoying
the "," is an actual character that i had to backspace to edit the calorie goal number
Dashboard looks good but "Log with AI" should not be default because what if the user wants to log a saved food?
Looks like theres no way to logged a saved food right now.
Settings is good.
Weekly History should be just be a monthly calendar with circles around each date indicating if the calorie target was met. The user can click on the day to see the macro split and logged food items.
Saved food menu is good.
